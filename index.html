        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Blink and You’ll Miss It is a fast-paced mini-game collection, the player will choose
            their favorite character, and enter his/her story. The mini-games are funny and
            relaxed, with different genres, perspectives, and control schemes. Each mini-game
            will last less than 20 seconds. During this short period, the player needs to quickly
            familiarize themselves with the mini-game, figure out what the win condition is, and
            after completing it get ready for the next one.</p>

        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>Every mini-game has a different way of being played, with dragging and touching
            the screen being the most common methods. This is because the majority of the
            games on the market utilize these interactions, so the player will be more familiar
            with these types of controls. We are experimenting with other controls such as
            tilting the phone or making use of the other sensors</p>
